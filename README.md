Made for Hack the North 2023 by Reezan Visram and Farzan Mirshekari.

## What is TeXtify?

LaTeX can be hard. Create beautiful and professional notes, research papers or assignments with just your voice.

## How does it work?

TeXtify captures your voice from your microphone, and uses NLP to convert your voice into LaTeX code. It accurately converts plain human english into LaTeX code for the equation.

## Why make TeXtify?

We are both engineering students, and spend countless hours writing out math, whether it be by hand or by tediously setting up a LaTeX environment and slowly learning how to use it. Now, anyone regardless of how neat their handwriting is, or how much they know about LaTeX can create beautiful, professional math documents.

## What's Next?

Stay tuned! We plan to turn this into a full-blown speech-to-text LaTeX editor, complete with document storage, full PDF support and many more exciting features! We want to be able to comfortably use this for university, and so many exciting features will be coming!
